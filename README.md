Optimizing Human Resource Allocation in Organization 

This study discussed about human resource allocation using linear programming to help in achieving optimal performanceand reducing manpower wastage
with a given budget.

Objective Function:
Maximize the performance rating by forming a team of 30 employees including human resource, sales executive, sales representative,research scientist, laboratory technician and manager.

The constraints have been identified as below:
1. salary constraint
2. position constraint
3. job satisfaction constraint
4. Working experience of manager constraint

Findings
30 employees are selected with the maximize value of the objective function. 
The total salary is $169,640 which is less than $200,000. 
The result shows the total number of candidates for each job role as predefined. 
The working experience of all the manager is less than 32 years. 
The job satisfaction rating for each candidate is more than or equal to 3. 
Thus, the optimal value of the objective function (performance rating) found in the feasible region is 119.
